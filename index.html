       <p>
           French Canadian cuisine is a national cuisine in the Canadian province of 
           Quebec descended from 16th century French cuisine. Quebec's cuisine began to 
           develop in New france from the labour-intensive nature of colonial life, the seasonality
           of ingredients and the need to conserve resources. Quebec's cuisine has been influenced
           by the province's history of fur trading and hunting, as well as Quebec's winters, soil fertility, 
           teachings from First Nations, British cuisine, American cuisine, historical trade 
           relations and some immigrant cuisines.

           Quebec is home to many unique dishes and is most famous for its poutine, tourtières,
           pâté chinois, pea soup,  fèves au lard, cretons and desserts such as grands-pères,
           pouding chômeur and tarte au sucre. A few of these dishes i plan to share here.

           Quebec is known for being the biggest producer of maple syrup on the planet,
           as 72% of the maple syrup sold in the world (and 90% sold in Canada) originates
           from Quebec. The province is also recognized for having created over 700
           different kings of cheese, some of which whom have won international contests.

           Here are a few recipes that i grew up with, and one that i only tried later in life
           but is very good! You'll find Quebec cuisine is very easy, usually very cheap and is incredibly
           delicious!
