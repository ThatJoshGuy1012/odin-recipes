        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Pouding ch么meur</em> otherwise known as the "<em>The poor man's pudding</em>" is a
            dessert that was created during the early years of the great depression in 
            <em>Quebec, Canada</em>. Today, it is casually served as a regional dessert, perhaps being 
            a bit more popular during the <em>saison des sucres</em>, when maple sap is collected
            and processed and is usually part of the offerings during a meal at a sugar shack,
            but it is not specifically a maple dessert.
