        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Place flour,salt, and frozen butter slices into the bowl of a food processor.
                    Pulse on and off until the butter is about the size of pease, about 30 seconds.
                    Stir vinegar into cold water; drizzle water/vinegar into the flour mixture.
                    Pulse on and off until mixture is crumbly and holds together when you pinch a piece off, about 10 seconds.
                    If dough isn't pressing together, drizzle in another tsp of water.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Transfer mixture to a work surface. Press it together until it becomes a lump of dough.
                    Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    and cayenne together in a small bowl.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place potato quarters in a saucepan; cover with cold water. Add 1 tsp kosher salt.
                    Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat. Simmer until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.
                    Scoop out potatoes and transfer to a bowl; save cooking liquid. 
                    Mash potatoes with a potato masher.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    Melt butter in a skilled over medium heat. Add chopped onion and a pinch of salt.
                    Cook and stir until onions turn golden, 10 to 15 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Stir garlic, celery and spice blend into the skillet with onions. Stir until onion mixture
                    is evenly coated with the spices, about 30 seconds. Add ground beef and ground pork.
                    Ladle about &frac34; cup of the potato cooking liquid into the skillet.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Cook and stir until meat is browned and has a very fine, almost pastelike texture.
                    Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender and most of the liquid has 
                    evaporated, about 45 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
