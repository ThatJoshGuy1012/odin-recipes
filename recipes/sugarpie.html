        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
                French-Canadian Sugar pie, otherwise known as <em><strong>Tarte au sucre</strong></em>, is a pie
            that originates from France that was presumably brought over to Quebec, and subsequently
            the rest of Canada, during colonization. Sugar pie varieties can also be found in other 
            western European countries, as well as throughout the mid-west in the US. Despite its name
            Sugar pie is not overly sweet, and has a rich creamy texture.
