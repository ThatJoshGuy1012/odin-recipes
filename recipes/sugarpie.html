        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
                French-Canadian Sugar pie, otherwise known as <em><strong>Tarte au sucre</strong></em>, is a pie
            that originates from France that was presumably brought over to Quebec, and subsequently
            the rest of Canada, during colonization. Sugar pie varieties can also be found in other 
            western European countries, as well as throughout the mid-west in the US. Despite its name
            Sugar pie is not overly sweet, and has a rich creamy texture.

        <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <h3>Pie Crust:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mix together vodka and water into a small measuring cup, then set aside. 
                    In a large mixing bowl, ass flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk to combine. 
                    Add in cold buter cubes, and work into the flour with your hands or a pastry cutter.
                    Work the butter until it is crumbly and about the size of peas.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Slowly drizzle in vodka-water while simultaneously tossing with a fork to combine.
                    After all the vodka-water has been added, knead the dough a few times inside the bowl
                    until shaggy dough forms. If the dough doesn't come together slowly add more water
                    until a shaggy dough forms.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Form dough, as best as you can, into a disk shape, then place into a 
                    freezer bag, then into the fridge for an hour to chill.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remove dough from fridge and place onto counter for 5 minutes to warm-up a bit.
                    Remove the dough from the freezer bag and place onto a well-floured work surface.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Roll dough out to be about &frac14;" thick, and about 10-11" in diameter.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place rolled out dough into a 9" pie plate, then trim the edges (and crimp them if you'd like).
                    Place the prepare pie plate back into the freezer for 30 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Filling and Baking:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Prehead oven to 350&deg;F. In a large mixing bowl whisk together 
                    the eggs, flour, and corn starch. Once smooth, add the softened butter 
                    and whisk together until the butter is well dispersed (a few butter chunks
                    here and there is fine). Add the brown sugar, evaporated milk, and salt to the bowl
                    and whisk until well-combined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remove the prepared pie plate from the freezer and pour the filling into the
                    the prepared pie plate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place the pie on top of a baking sheet and then place into the oven for 35-45 minutes.
                    When done, the filing should still be a little jiggly (it'll set after you pull it out).
                    Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for an hour and then place into the fridge 
                    for at least 4 hours to cool.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Serve cold with whipped cream, ice cream, or a sprinkling of flaky salt.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
